      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p><strong>We developed DashboardHR to meet the needs of growing businesses who need to escape the admin of managing their people.</strong></p>
      <p> We know what it’s like to manage a team and our goal is to let you escape from the HR admin so you can focus on growing your business. Breathe is a trading name of Centurion Management Systems Ltd.<br/>

      We had been implementing HR systems across the UK for over 22 years but then we found ourselves reviewing the available options for SMEs. We looked at the range of products on offer in the UK HR software market but none of these systems ticked all the boxes. So we decided to develop our own HR software solution – the result is Breathe, a fully web-based solution that is secure and reliable but above all simple to use.</p>
